# Trajectory of a SCARA robot from a binary image

This is an ingeneer project made in the engeenering school Télécom Physique Strasbourg.
The objective is to use a scara robot to write somethings on unplane surfaces. The thinks which need to be writed as based on an binary image. Here the image than we use is black letters on a white screen, and for the moment we only use letters with straight lines (no courbs like in a O).
We extract trajectory from the image to communicate whith the robot
